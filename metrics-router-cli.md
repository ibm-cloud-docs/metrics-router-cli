# Metrics Routing CLI
{: #metrics-router-cli}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} command-line interface (CLI) provides extra capabilities for service offerings. This information describes how you can use the CLI to define and manage settings for your {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full}} instance by using the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

## Installing the CLI
{: #mr-cli-prereq}

* Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
* Install the CLI by running the following command:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud plugin install metrics-router
   ```
   {: pre}

You're notified on the command line when updates to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up to date so that you can use the most current commands. You can view the current version of all installed plug-ins by running `ibmcloud plugin list`.
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #mr-prereq}

Before you configure {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} routes or targets, you must configure a primary metadata region. The primary metadata region is configured using the [`ibmcloud metrics-router setting update` command `--primary-metadata-region` option.](#settings-update-cli)

If you you do not have a primary metadata region configured, your route and target command will fail.

## ibmcloud metrics-router route create
{: #route-create-cli}

Use this command to create a new route to {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} targets.

Targets must be {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instances.
{: restriction}

```sh
ibmcloud metrics-router route create --name ROUTE_NAME ( --rules RULES |  --file RULES_DEFINITION_JSON_FILE ) [--output FORMAT] [--force]
```
{: pre}

### Command options
{: #route-create-options}

`--name ROUTE_NAME`
:   The name to be given to the route.

   Do not include any personal identifying information (PII) in any resource names.
   {: important}

`--file RULES_DEFINITION_JSON_FILE`
:   A JSON file that contains the definition of the rules for route. The file needs to be formatted as follows:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "targets": [{"id":"ID1"},{"id":"ID2"}]
     }
   ]
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Where `targets` is a comma-separated list of target IDs.

   The rule definition can optionally also include inclusion filters. For example,

   ```json
   [{
       "action": "send",
       "targets": [{
         "id":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
       }],
       "inclusion_filters": [
           {
             "operand": "service_name",
             "operator": "in",
             "values": [
               "appconnect",

           }
       ]
     }]
   ```
   {: codeblock}

    Where:

   `action`
   :   Action defines whether {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full}} includes or excludes metrics on the route. Two actions are supported: `send` and `drop`. If not specified, the default action is to send the metrics.

      `send`
      :   Metrics are sent, based on the routing rule, on the defined route.

      `drop`
      :   Metrics are excluded, based on the routing rule, when metrics are sent on the defined route.

      :   Values appropriate to an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service that generates metrics managed through [{{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-cloud-services-mr)

`--rules RULES`
:   A JSON formatted rule definition enclosed in single quotation marks. For example,

## ibmcloud metrics-router setting update
{: #settings-update-cli}

Use this command to modify current settings such as the default targets, permitted target regions, primary and secondary metadata regions in {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}. Any value that is different from when the target was originally created is updated to the value specified in the command. If no options are specified, the current settings are returned.

Before you disable public endpoints by setting `--private-api-endpoint-only TRUE`, make sure your account has access to the private endpoint.  You can do this by running the command `ibmcloud account show`.  If `VRF Enabled` is `true` and `Service Endpoint Enabled` is `true` then you have access to the private endpoint. If you do not have access to the private endpoint, you cannot enable the public endpoint. Private endpoint access is required to enable the public endpoint.
